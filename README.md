# Overview 
There are two layers in the Git Repo for Argo.
## Clusters
This contains the app-of-apps configuration for arrgo
## Components
This contains all of the deployments. Under here there are two layers
### Operators
Where all of the  operator subscriptions live
###Platform
Where the applications and operator instances live

## Applications
I have made no place for the FinSight Application. Maybe that could be in mono-repo/application.
